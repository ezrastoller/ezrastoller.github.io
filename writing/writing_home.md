**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): Dear Lucy, my love -

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Dear father,

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): How are you? Are your lips still as red and rosy as I remember them? I miss the softness of your cheeks, and the sweet sound of your voice.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Hello.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): Here, the weather is sunny and beautiful, and when it’s windy all the flowers look like they’re dancing.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): There have been storms every night.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): I’m doing wonderfully. Our camp is well supplied food-wise. Sometimes we even have meat! 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Father, we’re really struggling after the last battle. We had to retreat and we left behind a lot of rations. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): I was elected to carry the flag into the last battle. I was extremely honored.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): I can’t shoot with accuracy, father. So they placed me on flag duty. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): My dear, I think I may be promoted soon. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): With so many casualties, I think it’s possible that I’ll become an officer. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): I’ve been doing my best to take orders from the commanding officers, but I must say, they treat us sometimes as if we are young adolescent youth children. We’re 20 years of age, for goodness sake!

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to the right): I’ve been diligently following orders, just like you taught me. I greatly respect and admire the charisma, intelligence, and undying spirit of my superiors.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): We’ve been hearing about something called... the Liberation Declaration? (I think that’s what it’s called.) There are rumors that it would free the slaves - just like we’ve been fighting for!

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Father, I don’t want to worry you, but there is news of some announcement that will free the slaves. I know it might be troubling to you, and leave you with lots of questions. As you know, I am still not sure where I stand on slavery, but I hope you will accept my perspective when I do.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): It’s refreshing to have met a few men who see eye to eye with us on this matter.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Father, the majority of men here are aligned with your beliefs.

LOUIS enters. 

**LOUIS**: Hey, Andrew. We really need you to move some supplies from this tent to the general’s tent. 

**ANDREW**: Right, no problem. Can do!  (Andrew gets up, goes to move supplies, then sits back down and starts to write again.)

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): I miss the way your beautiful hair shimmers in the moonlight. Especially like last summer, when we spent every night sitting on the docks, our bare feet dangling in the lapping waves. I haven’t told anyone about those precious moments we spent together. Even the nights when we snuck out to the “barn.” 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): It is difficult shaving here with the lack of soap and mirrors. I keep trying to go against the grain like you always do, but I have nicked my chin in a few tricky spots. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): Write back soon! I treasure all of your letters and always keep them tucked away in my undershirt, close to my heart.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): Please give my best to Mother.

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his right): With love, Andy Pandy Pumpkin Dandy. 

**ANDREW** (Writing on the paper to his left): Best, Andrew Donald Hiddleston III.

Andrew leaves the stage and we see his girlfriend Lucy enter stage left and his father enter stage right. We see them open their letters, nodding and reading along for most of it.

**LUCY**: ...It’s refreshing to have met a few men who see eye to eye with us on this matter. “It is difficult shaving here with the lack of soap and mirrors. I keep trying to go against the grain like you always do, but I have nicked my chin in a few tricky spots.” ?

**FATHER**: Beautiful hair...? Bare feet dangling? Why is the barn in quotations? Andy Pandy?! Good god.
