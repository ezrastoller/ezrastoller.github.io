A House Divided

Characters: LINCOLN, SECRETARY SEWARD, REPRESENTATIVE BIRD, REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN

Setting: Around a table in a conference room.
______

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: Congratulations, Mr. Lincoln on your senate nomination. The Republican party loves your chances for winning Illinois.

**LINCOLN**: Thank you. I’m excited about my chances too. I can’t rest on my laurels though--my acceptance speech for the nomination had better be very good. I was thinking of calling it “A House Divided.”

**REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN**: A house divided? 

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.

**REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN**: That’s--um, a little biblical. Let us see the speech.

(Lincoln hands them his draft)

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” That’s ridiculous. Why would a house divided not be able to stand? What happened to the foundation?

**REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN**: But we can fix it. How about, “This nation is like a PB&J sandwich, you like when the flavors mix, but they don’t without you putting your fingers in the filling a little bit.”

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: Great! Or like, “This nation is like a failing union...like a marriage... Like mine.”

**REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN**: Hm...maybe something more general? “This nation is like...a penny. There’s two sides to it and they’re different.”

**LINCOLN**: I think I’m trying for subtle. A house divided is great, right? Subtle, metaphorical, snappy. Thomas Paine talked about it in Common Sense.

**REPRESENTATIVE LOGAN**: That is so derivative.

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: Please, just plagiarize. Have no sense of integrity.

Seward enters in a frenzy, unaware that Lincoln is already in the room.

**SEWARD**: Hey! There’s an emergency! Lincoln’s just sent me his latest draft of the speech and it’s awful! He says (reading from paper; says this next line at the same time as Logan) “A house divided cannot sta--” (starting to look up from paper in confusion) How did you kno-oh (sees Lincoln, is shocked). I am so sorry. 

**LINCOLN**: Is it really bad? 

**SEWARD**: (Inhales deeply) Yeaah.

**REPRESENTATIVE BIRD**: Worse than my marriage. 

**LINCOLN**: That bad?

**ALL**: Yeah. 

**SEWARD**: I’ve got it! What if it’s about an apartment?

**LOGAN**: Yea! And it’s on the sixth floor!

**BIRD**: No, 7th floor! 

**SEWARD**: Yeah! 

**LINCOLN**: What?

**LOGAN**: And it’s split in two! 

**BIRD**: And it has windows!

**LINCOLN**: How is this better than a house?

**SEWARD**: Way catchier! 

**BIRD**: It’s for the middle-class! 

**LOGAN**: Perfect - this nation is like a seventh floor windowed middle-class apartment split into two! (people applause.)

**LINCOLN**: Okay, well, let’s table this for now and go to our other speech -

**BIRD**: Oh right, the preliminary draft of the liberation declaration! 

**LINCOLN**: What if we called it the emancipation procla--

**BIRD** and **SEWARD**: No one knows what emancipation means.
