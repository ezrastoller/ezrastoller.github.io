title: Why Does My Grandmother Perm Her Hair?
tags: chirp
---
My grandmother, Bubs, has had a perm since my mom was little, and looks a little bit like George Washington, if he were a Japanese woman. But, she hasn't always had this look. I have seen photos of her as a teenager with straight black hair, just like my mom's.

What inspired her to try this look and stick with it? As styles changed through the decades, Bubs' hairdo has remained constant.
