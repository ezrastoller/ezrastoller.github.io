title: Why Does My Grandmother Perm Her Hair?
tags: chirp
---
My grandmother, Bubs, has had a perm since my mom was little, and looks a little bit like George Washington if he were a Japanese woman. But, she hasn't always had this look. I have seen photos of her as a teenager with straight black hair, just like my mom's.

What inspired her to try this look and stick with it? As styles changed through the decades, Bubs' hairdo has remained constant.

Right now, I'm really happy with my hairdo - shorter on the sides, longer and swept to the side on top. Maybe I'll stick with this style for a while until I'm a grandparent. 

But I guess I had thought that about my hair when I had a buzzcut, just a couple years ago.
