title: Buying Pork For the First Time

A couple weeks ago, my dad was out of town for a meeting. I was cooking dinner for Bubs, my mom and myself. We all eat and enjoy pork, but don't prepare pork at home because my brother and dad don't eat it.

All of a sudden, it was my chance. I dug up [a recipe for Taiwanese braised pork](http://thewoksoflife.com/2015/06/lu-rou-fan-taiwanese-braised-pork-rice-bowl/) and went to the local butcher to pick up the pork shoulder.

I have gone to butcher shops a lot with my dad and with my mom. I know which types of lamb we get for stew, and which types of fish and chicken we get when we barbeque. I realized that I had no idea what pork shoulder really looked like though.

As I saw the butcher get me a little over a pound of pork shoulder, I saw that the large cut of meat was wrapped in twine - who knew? When I got home, I sliced it into small cubes. Another first! I have now cut up pork in the kitchen at home.

I look forward to cooking pork more as an adult. I respect my dad and brother's choice to not eat pork, but I will say that it tasted really good.
