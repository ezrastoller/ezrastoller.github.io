title: Buying Pork For the First Time

A couple weeks ago, my dad was out of town for a meeting. I was cooking dinner for Bubs, my mom and myself. We all eat and enjoy pork, but don't prepare pork at home because my brother and dad don't eat it.

All of a sudden, it was my chance. I dug up [a recipe for Taiwanese braised pork](http://thewoksoflife.com/2015/06/lu-rou-fan-taiwanese-braised-pork-rice-bowl/) and went to the local butcher to pick up the pork shoulder.

As I saw the butcher get me a little over a pound of pork shoulder, I saw that the large cut of meat was wrapped in twine - who knew? When I got home, I sliced it into small cubes. Another first! I have now cut up pork in the kitchen at home.

I'm not sure why I felt guilty for doing this, but it felt great and the braised pork tasted great.
