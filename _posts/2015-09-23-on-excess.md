While I was LA, my friend and were driving through Beverly Hills on our way home from an improv show. As we passed the mansions, gates, and high hedges, my friend said that he thought it would be so fun to live in a home like that.

I responded immediately and incredulously - "Really?!" For me, it seemed all to be a bit gratuitous. I don't really need *two* swimming pools. As I explained my reasoning, I picked up my iPhone, looked at the instructions on the screen, and reminded my friend to turn left in .2 miles.

"You don't NEED your iPhone, Ez," my friend replied.  He went on the remind me how I would live a fully functional life without it. I also don't need *two* pairs of sandals.

So often I think of excess as fixed line, rather than a line that we all draw in a slightly different place. 

I don't think I would ever want two swimming pools. But, I'd be happy with one.
