While I was LA, my friend and were driving through Beverly Hills. As we drove by mansion after mansion, my friend said that he thought it would be so fun to live in a home like that.

I responded immediately and incredulously - "Really?!" For me, it seemed all to be a bit gratuitous. I don't need *two* swimming pools. 

"You don't NEED your iPhone, Ez," my friend replied. I also don't need *two* pairs of sandals.

So often I think of excess as fixed line, rather than a line that we all draw in a slightly different place. 

I don't think I would ever want two swimming pools. But, I'd be happy with one.
