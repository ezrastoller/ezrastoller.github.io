I've had some down time at home this summer and have enjoyed cooking dinner many nights. I don't know much about Korean cooking, but have grown to really love gochujang.

[Gochujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang) is a Korean chili paste, that also has glutinous rice powder and fermented soy in it. It brings a good amount of heat, and a little sweetness, too.

I've enjoyed using gochujang outside the context of Korean cooking. Today, while making a Spanish style chicken for dinner, with tomatoes, eggplant, onion, garlic, I decided to add a heaping tablespoon of gochujang. It brightened the color and the flavor of the sauce.

As I prepare to embark on my year long trip to Peru, I look forwrad to learning to cook with Peruvian spices, and then experimenting with them in new contexts, too.
