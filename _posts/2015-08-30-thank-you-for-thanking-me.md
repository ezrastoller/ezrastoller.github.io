title: Thank You For Thanking Me!

I have trouble finding a natural end to conversations. Just today, I emailed my friend asking him to put me in touch with one of his former classmates. After he did that, I emailed him, thanking him for his help, and then he emailed me, thanking me for keeping in touch and keeping him updated on my postgrad plans.

When will the thank yous stop? I am tempted to email him back, thanking him for being in touch even when he's so busy gearing up for another school year.

At the core, this sequence of thank yous serve as much appreciated read-receipts. There exists a level of internet standoffishness - not wanting to immediately respond to something or else you might seem to available or not busy enough. These thank yous felt a little silly, yet were also transparent, and refreshing.
