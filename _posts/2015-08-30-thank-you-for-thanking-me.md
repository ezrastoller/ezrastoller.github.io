title: Thank You For Thanking Me!

I have trouble finding a natural end to conversations, both in real life, and over email. Just today, I emailed my friend asking them to put me in touch with one of his former classmates. After he did that, I emailed him, thanking him for helping me out, and then he emailed me, thanking me for keeping in touch and keeping him updated on my postgrad plans.

When will the thank yous stop? I am tempted to email him back, thanking him for being in touch with me during a busy time of year for him, as he gears up for another year with RA responsibilities, in addition to his own PhD coursework. 

At the core, this sequence of thank yous serve as much appreciated read-receipts. There exists a level of internet standoffishness - not wanting to immediately respond to something or else you might seem to available or not busy enough. These thank yous felt a little silly, yet were also transparent, and refreshing.
