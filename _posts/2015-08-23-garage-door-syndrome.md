On my way home, I often think about which snack I'll nibble on in the kitchen before going to my room upstairs. Yet almost invariably, as I fumble my key to unlock the door, I get an urge to go to the bathroom, even though I often don't come home consciously "holding it."

My dad, a urologist, calls this Garage Door Syndrome. 

Am I just really good at holding it, or is this a real psychological phenomenon? Perhaps the extent to which I feel emotionally and psychologically at ease at home manifests itself physiologically in my ability to, all of sudden, physically let it go.
