title: People Like Sitting Next to Me on Muni
tags: chirp

Recently, I have noticed that fellow Muni riders often choose to sit next to me over other people on the bus or the train. Perhaps it's because my young face seems to pose no threat.

When I was younger, my young appearance and unimposing build were both points of endless frustration. I sometimes felt that it was because of my appearence that I wasn't taken seriously or that people would underestimate what I was capable of doing.

Although I still sometimes wish I were bigger, I have recently realized some of the perks and unearned privileges of my appearance. In an era of unfathomable police brutality, I realize that I am lucky that strangers don't assume that I'm a threat, are willing to help me out when I'm in a bind, and sit next to me on a crowded bus.
