This [animated short film](https://vimeo.com/14661112), La Maison en Petit Cubes, is beautiful. Japanese animator Kunio Kat≈ç creates a beautiful world in which the passage of time physically manifests itself as rising water.

In the film, the protagonist dons SCUBA gear and explores the ruins of his past in the stories below.

There's a beauty in reminiscing from time to time, but this film shows us that if we did that all the time, we would drown.
