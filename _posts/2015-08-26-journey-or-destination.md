title: Journey or Destination?

I really enjoyed reading [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/ben-schlappig-airlines-fly-free-20150720) about a young man who has made a living by gaming different frequent flyer programs and spends virtually all of his time in airports or airplanes, endlessly jetsetting from continent to continent in glamorous lounges and first-class accomodation.

It is often said that the journey is as important as the destination. Sure, it doesn't really matter what the destination is, but the journey *does* derive some of its meaning from the existence of a destination nonetheless. This article though, talks a lot about a neverending journey,  with no end destination in sight. 

Perhaps the destination on the horizon for Ben Schlappig is a growing mastery and understanding of the complex world of airline miles and the different ways the world is connected. The actual time spent in the air and between terminals is just part of the game.
