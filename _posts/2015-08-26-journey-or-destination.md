title: Journey or Destination?

I really enjoyed reading [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/ben-schlappig-airlines-fly-free-20150720) about a young man who has made a living off of legally gaming different frequent flyer programs and spends virtually all of his time in airports or airplanes. It gave me a good peak into a whole niche of people obsessed with flying. In many ways this life seemed cush and glamorous, perpetually jetsetting from continent to continent.

It is often said that the journey is as important as the destination, and in general, I buy into that philosophy.  It doesn't really matter what the destination is, but the journey does derive some of its meaning from the existence of a destination nonetheless. This article though, talks a lot about the neverending journey,  with no end destination in sight. 

Perhaps the destination on the horizon for Ben Schlappig is a growing mastery and understanding of the complex world of airline miles and different ways the world is connected. The actual time spent in the air and between terminals is just part of the game.
