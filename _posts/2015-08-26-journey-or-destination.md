title: Journey or Destination?

I really enjoyed reading [this article](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/ben-schlappig-airlines-fly-free-20150720) about Ben Schlappig, who has made a living by legally gaming frequent flyer programs and spends all of his time in airports or airplanes, glamorously jetsetting from continent to continent, often in first-class.

Many say the journey is as important as the destination. Sure, it doesn't really matter what the destination is, but the journey *does* derive some of its meaning from the existence of a destination nonetheless. This article talks about a neverending journey,  with no end destination in sight. 

Perhaps the destination on the horizon for Schlappig is a growing mastery and understanding of the complex world of airline miles and the different ways the world is connected. The actual time spent in the air and between terminals is just part of the game.
