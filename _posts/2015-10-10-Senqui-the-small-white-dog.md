I am not very comfortable around animals. I never know what to do. Should I pet them? What if they don't like me? How do I give them attention, but also maintain personal space? Is it condescending to talk to them in incomplete sentences?

While organizing housing in Lima, I was quite lucky to find a Chinese Peruvian host family, the Fangs. In an incredible chain of friendship, my friend from childhood Eliza has a friend from Wesleyan, Sam, whose family friend, the Fangs generously offered for me to stay in on of their rooms in their apartment in Lima. While corresponding with Wendy over Whatsapp, the phone and email, it all seemed like a great set up. Wifi - check. Safe area - check. Husband does Chinese calligraphy - check. It seeemed like a great match for my project to learn more about the Chinese diaspora in Peru. What a fit!

Wendy generously offered to pick me up from the airport. On our way back to her apartment, we chatted in Mandarin about my project and our respective backgrounds. The streets of Lima were crowded, though apparently the city made efforts to cut down congestion because of a large IMF conference being hosted in the city in early October.

We pulled into the garage of the apartment building and made our way to the fifth floor of the building. I walked to my room, put down my things and took a look around. Nice, clean bed. Access to a small balcony. I couldn't complain. As I walked out of my room towards the kitchen, I heard a skid of paws on the hardwood floors.

Paws.

An energetic white dog stood in front of the kitchen and wouldn't let me through. The dog would not stop barking. I didn't know what to do. Every time I tried to pet the dog, the dog jumped up at me. I probably started releasing stress pheromones that the dog sensed, which then spiraled out of the control in horrible positive feedback loop. 

Eventually I sat on the floor and was no longer towering over Senqui, the word in Tibetan for lion, pronounced in Spanish. Senqui gradually let me pet him, and after petting behind his ears, he seemed to calm down and let me into the kitchen. After a delicious homecooked lunch of arroz con pollo, I went to use the bathroom. 

The barking started again. I hadn't been cleared by Senqui to use the bathroom. I sat back down on the floor, pet Senqui on the tummy, and spoke to him in broken Mandarin and Spanish. "¿Estás loco?" I asked him. “干嘛啊?” Eventually I was cleared to use the bathroom. 

I'm still gaining Senqui clearance to go to different parts of the apartment, but have gradually become more comfortable around him. I'm still not quite sure what to do around dogs, but don't feel so stressed about not knowing what to do. Senqui, thank you for your patience with a new guest in the apartment. I still think you're crazy, but I also admit that you are fluffy and cute as well.
