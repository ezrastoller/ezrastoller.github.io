Texting is fun, but also stressful. The hopeful three blinking dots that suddenly go blank. The read receipts. The punctuation, the capitalization, the lack thereof.

I recently was in touch with a friend and ended a complete sentence with a comma instead of a period. 



Me: Hi!


Someone Else: Hey! wanna get dinner?


Me: I would,



It probably sent a funny message and I quickly clarified with him that I had nothing further to add. I realized though, that ending a text with an unnecessary comma is a fun, pretty harmless troll that inserts a cliffhanger and suspense into everyday conversation. Every once in a while, this is a fun troll to fall back on.
