Thanksgiving in Peru was my first bout of homesickness. It was the first time I had ever been away from family on my favorite holiday. I had a fun, pretty normal, Thursday on Thanksgiving in Lima, but found myself thinking of those I miss back in the US more than normal.

As I pictured the faces of loved ones, I realized that I could visualize their hands as well. Bubs' hitchhiker thumbs came into clear view.

We remember faces all the time. For me, it seemed that if I could visualize someone's hands too, I felt a particular closeness and fondness towards that person. 

I wonder who's hands I'll remember when I leave Peru.
