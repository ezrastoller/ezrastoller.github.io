I recently was having dinner with our British family friend who explaining why some taxi drivers in London were frustrated at Uber. Andy explained how those who drive those signature London cabs spend years learning The Knowledge, and have to be able to navigate the city without the aid of a map or navigation system. Many spend over two years learning the Knowledge.
The idea behind the knowledge is that a cab driver in London would have intimate knowledge of the city - it's almost as if the driver becomes a guide as well.

Uber has an entirely different model, as it allows anyone to be a cab driver. Rather than relying on the Knowledge, the driver's directions come from a GPS system. Although the drivers are not as trained, Uber often is cheaper and more convenient than a cab.

Having grown up in San Francisco all my life, many parts of the city I know quite well. In a sense, I have my own "Knowledge" that I am proud of. 

I still like seeing a smart phone on the dashboard though.
