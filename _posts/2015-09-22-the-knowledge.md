I recently learned about how cab drivers in London spend years learning The Knowledge, and have to be able to navigate the city without a map or navigation system. Many spend over two years learning the Knowledge. Having mastered the Knowledge, the cab driver almost becomes a guide, too.

Uber has an entirely different model, as it allows anyone to be a cab driver. Rather than relying on the Knowledge, the driver's directions come from a GPS system. Although the drivers are not as trained, Uber often is cheaper and more convenient than a cab.

Having grown up in San Francisco all my life, many parts of the city I know quite well. In a sense, I have my own "Knowledge" that I am proud of. 

I still feel comforted seeing a smart phone on the dashboard though.
