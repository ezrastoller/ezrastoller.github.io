title: Reading a Parenting Book

I was recently sitting in my parents' bedroom with my dad, while he read the newspaper before going to bed. I was staring at the 
bookshelf by the window and noticed a book, *Does Anybody Else Look Like Me? A Parent's Guide to Raising Multiracial Children*. I had never noticed it before.

I pulled the book off the shelf, bid my dad good night, and sat in my bed reading it. It was bizarre, funny and a little uncomfortable, but I couldn't stop.

Beyond the content of the book, which at times seemed a little silly, I never thought about my parents buying a parenting book. My mom and dad have been great parents and I always have had this sense that they knew what they were doing at all times.

Finding and reading this book was a nice reminder that my parents were and are trying to figure things out, just like the rest of us.
