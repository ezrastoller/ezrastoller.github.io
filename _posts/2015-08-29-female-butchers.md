I have been to Guerra Meats more times than I can count. Today, like many nights, I drove down the hill to pick something up for dinner. On my way home today though, I realized for the first time that all the butchers working behind the counter were men. 

Then, I started to think about other grocery stores where my family often goes to buy meat. All the familiar faces behind the counter at our favorite Asian markets, at Andronico's, Tower Market and more were all men.

I realize that my sample size here is small, and that female butchers must exist. But this did make me think more broadly about how things are so arbitrarily gendered.  Traditionally women eat and prepare meat quite a bit when dealing with all that is domestic. But why then, is butchering and grilling so often dad's job on July 4th?
