title: Why Do Prescription Drugs Have Commercials?
tags: chirp
---
I watch Jeopardy almost every day with my grandma and I still can't tell if I love or hate Alex Trebek. I've gotten used to most of the commercials they run for the 7 - 7:30 timeslot -- spaghetti sauce ads, ads for Bounty paper towels, and promotions of other ABC programming.

I still don't completely understand the commercials for prescription drugs. I'm not diminishing the pain of Opiate Induced Constipation. I just feel that if I were suffering from something a little more complex, I would go to a doctor instead of trying to treat myself. 

Yet, by paying for these ads, these prescription drug companies also seem to be promoting direct consumption of their medications by patients, even though they're prescription drugs.
