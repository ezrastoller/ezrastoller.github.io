    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Ezra, a senior at Harvard College, majoring in Social Studies, an honors interdisciplinary major combining philosophy, 
      political science and economics, and minoring in Chinese. I just finished my senior thesis about institutional 
      senior care in contemporary Beijing, which drew both on Confucian texts and interviews from my field 
      research in Beijing during the summer of 2014. Outside of class, I enjoy writing, reading, and painting. I have studied Chinese brush painting and 
      calligraphy with Joseph Yan and Janny Huang since 1999 in San Francisco. My teachers were the subject of educator, Herbert 
      Kohl's book, Painting Chinese, about artistic pedagogy.
      
      Born and raised in San Francisco, I love wearing a sweatshirt to the beach and biking up steep hills.
