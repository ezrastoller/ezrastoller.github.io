    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Ezra, a 2015 graduate of Harvard College, where I majored in Social Studies, an honors interdisciplinary major combining philosophy, 
      political science and economics, and minored in Chinese. I wrote my senior thesis about institutional 
      senior care in contemporary Beijing, which drew both on Confucian texts and interviews from my field 
      research in Beijing during the summer of 2014.

      I received the Trustman Fellowship from Harvard, which funds a year of purposeful travel after graduation. This year (October 2015 - Summer 2016),  I will be living in Lima, Peru, learning about the Chinese diaspora there. Having studied Chinese brush painting and calligraphy since I was young, I plan on using Chinese materials and techniques to create a collection of paintings of Peruvian subject matter. Through this, I hope to celebrate the beauty that can come from different cultures meeting and mixing.

      I studied painting and calligraphy with Joseph Yan and Janny Huang for twelve years. Trained in China, Yan and Huang have co-run an art school in San Francisco since 1992. My teachers were the subject of educator, Herbert 
      Kohl's book, <i>Painting Chinese</i>, about artistic pedagogy.
      
      Other interests of mine include improv comedy, coxswaining, oral history and creative nonfiction. I like to dabble.

      Born and raised in San Francisco, I love wearing a sweatshirt to the beach and biking up steep hills.
