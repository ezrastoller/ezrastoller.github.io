    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Ezra, a senior at Harvard College, majoring in Social Studies, an honors interdisciplinary major combining philosophy, political science and economics, and minoring in Chinese. I just finished my senior thesis, which was about institutional senior care in contemporary Beijing, China, which drew both of Confucian texts and interviews from my summer 2014 field work in Beijing. Outside of class, I enjoy writing, reading, and painting. I have studied Chinese brush painting and calligraphy with Joseph Yan and Janny Huang since 1999 in San Francisco. My teachers were the subject of educator, Herbert Kohl's book, Painting Chinese, about artistic pedagogy.
