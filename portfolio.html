       Hi, I'm Ezra Stoller. I'm a 2015 graduate of Harvard College, and am living in Lima for the year studying the Chinese diaspora in Peru as a Trustman Traveling Fellow. Read more about me <a href="http://ezrastoller.github.io/about.html">here</a>.
       I have studied Chinese brush painting and calligraphy for fifteen years and am also painting a collection of watercolors of Peruvian everyday life with Chinese materials (rice paper, Chinese ink). Take a look at some my art samples <a href="http://ezrastoller.github.io/art.html">here.</a>
